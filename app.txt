Heading- I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! Never miss your favorite flavor ever again.

Get notified when Amy’s is serving up your favorite flavors.

Pick your poison: ice cream, frozen yogurt, fruit ice
(icons for each type in middle of circles)

 == Flavor selection page ==
User sees a very simple grid where each square contains a flavor. This is similar layout to HTML music board.

Allow user to choose up to 3 flavors for alerts either by **scrolling or searching.** If user chooses more than 3, display humorous message about “slowing down”.

User can simply type to filter flavors. Use large search box similar to example Dan showed that one day

Once user makes selection, transparent gray comes over page with two modals:
1. to the left are three boxes showing the selected flavors
2. to the right is a box to enter text message for alerts
(these are centered on page)

At end, a test message is sent to tell user they are signed up for alerts!
